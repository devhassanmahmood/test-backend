**MyRor**

Rails backend for the MyRor React/Electron Smart mirror

**Why I built This**

My motivation for building MyRor is a bit selfish-- I typically spend a fair amount of time in my bathroom setting up the technology I need to help me do some of the things I need to make my day successful. I typically have my phone and a speaker to play music or a podcast, and sometimes my iPad to play a youtube video. MyRor combines all of those technological functions into a piece of hardware that is a mainstay in every bathroom. I hope it is of use to some folks!
